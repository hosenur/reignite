'Sell Shovels' during the gold rush' - this is what was followed by many people on twitter which made them build their own starter template for SaaS applications and sell it for a hefty price
Reignite packs a Remix Web App with Nextra Docs + Marketing  site.
It comes with few pre-configured packages for styling and authentication.
#### Remix
Remix serves as the main web application for this template. Running remix on any infra is easier than NextJS, also it has some pretty established data loading, and action patterns.

#### BullMQ
BullMQ serves as the broker for the worker pattern. There is a @reignite/queues package where you canc reate queues, import them in your web app, and pass jobs, which then can be handled by a node server, provided everything is connected to the same Redis Server.
